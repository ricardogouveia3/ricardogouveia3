## Hi there 👋

I'm Ricardo Gouveia (he/him), a front-end developer and UI designer from Brazil 🇧🇷. I specialize in front-end frameworks like React and Angular, mobile apps development with React Native, and interaction design for mobile and web.

I'm actively working towards becoming a technical anchor and community manager, specializing in front-end development. I contribute to the developer community by writing articles on platforms like dev.to, while also taking on leadership roles as the organizer of the HTML-SP meetup group and a speaker at local meetups.

### ⚡ Fun facts

- 🗣 I was born in the northeast of Brazil, raised in the north, and now live in the southeast. My Portuguese accent is a unique mix of all those places—I can't even define it myself!
- 📸 I enjoy photography, and you can check out some of my clicks on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@rcrd_landscape)
- 🛩 I used to be afraid of flying, but now I'm an aviation nerd and know more about airplanes than I probably should...
- 🕹 I'm a PC gamer, but I also have a deep love for old video games. I own original SNES, N64, and GameBoy Advance SP consoles.
