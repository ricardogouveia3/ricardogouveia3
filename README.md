## Hi there 👋

I'm Ricardo Gouveia (he/him), a front-end developer and UI designer from Brazil. I'm mostly working front-end framewoks like Angular and Vue, and interaction design for mobile and web apps.

As a community manager aspirate, I try to collaborate with some Meetup groups talks here in São Paulo, and articles about soft and technical skills online. You can check that content on links down below.

I also like to study and discuss about presentation design.
