## Hi there 👋

I'm Ricardo Gouveia (he/him), a front-end developer and UI designer from Brazil 🇧🇷. I specialize in front-end frameworks like React and Angular, mobile apps development with React Native, and interaction design for mobile and web.

I'm actively working towards becoming a technical anchor and community manager, specializing in front-end development. I contribute to the developer community by writing articles on platforms like dev.to, while also taking on leadership roles as the organizer of the HTML-SP meetup group and a speaker at local meetups.
